# PHP Developer Tools

I had a few little PoC's and ideas about such things as build systems, converters, etc. So here, I'll gather them all together! :)

Feel free to reuse the code, redo it, anything you want to. ^-^

## PCC

PCC is no longer a PoC. It can compile PHP scripts that belong to the PHP 5.3 standart. 5.4+ is yet to come. It uses the ph7 project (included in the pcc folder) in combination with the specified source script to build a real binary.

Consider it BETa.
